/// Owns a real native window (Photino, a thin WebView2/WebKitGTK/WKWebView wrapper)
/// pointed at the same local Kestrel server everything else already talks to - unlike
/// the previous approach of launching an external browser process (BrowserLauncher.cs,
/// kept as the fallback here if the platform's webview runtime isn't installed), which
/// never gave us a window handle to reliably single-instance or reposition.
///
/// The single PhotinoWindow instance is created once and kept alive for the rest of the
/// process's lifetime - "closing" it (the X button, or the tray icon reopening it later)
/// minimizes it instead of destroying it. This isn't just a UX choice: creating a
/// *second* PhotinoWindow instance after a first one is actually destroyed reliably
/// crashes the whole process natively (a silent, unrecoverable process death - no
/// catchable .NET exception, confirmed by reproducing it directly: the process was
/// consistently gone within ~1s of the second window's Load() call completing). Never
/// destroying the window at all sidesteps that failure mode entirely, which matters more
/// than being able to fully dispose of the native window before quitting the app (which
